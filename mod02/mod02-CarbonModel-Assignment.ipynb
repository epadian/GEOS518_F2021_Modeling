    "In the accompanying notebook [mod02-CarbonModel1.ipynb](./mod02-CarbonModel1.ipynb) and in class we developed a relatively simple model of global carbon balance that assumed that tracked carbon in the atmosphere and biosphere. The system of equations we developed to describe this system are shown below,\n",

    "where $M_1$ is the mass of carbon in the atmosphere (GtC), $M_2$ is the mass of carbon in the biosphere (GtC), $F_{12}$ is the flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the biosphere due to photosynthesis (GtC/yr), and $F_{21}$ is the flux of carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere due to decay and respiration (GtC/yr).\n",
    "\n",
    "In that notebook we develop a numerical model to describe that system, run it for given initial conditions and with no external inputs of carbon (we call this an \"unforced\" scenario) and compare it to the analytical solution. We observed that as the time step increased, we departed further from the analytical solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will take your model one step more realistic by ensuring that the photosynthetic flux depends on both the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and in the biosphere. Then you will examine the impact of anthropogenic emissions from 1751-2008 on the biosphere and atmosphere, and how alternative future scenarios of emissions mitigation affect your system. \n",
